Blogging is not something that has come so naturally to me. Despite following many, many blogs on various topics, and despite feeling inspired to follow the example those blogs set by curating my own content, I never can seem to get into a comfortable workflow that allows me to easily integrate blog post composition with my daily life.

It's a bit of an odd thing, really, since said integration would check off many of my fundamental needs simultaneously. If I may briefly digress: I am an academic and hobbyist programmer with ADHD; often times the focus required to work in one area (driven by passion, curiosity, boredom, existential dread... what have you) will have a parasitic effect on focus on other areas. That is, if I have an upcoming deadline and I am driven to work on a manuscript, focus on that project will very frequently attrit the ability to work on others...

... in the most "ideal" case, that is. Usually it is the other way around, where the less important project or focus detracts from focus on the much more pressing focus.

I counteract this through multiple methods, part of a veritable utility belt of tools and tricks to get myself to Do The Thing. Sometimes that involves just re-evaluating an action-reward loop that I've gotten myself into, but other times it means I have to drag myself kicking and screaming away from The Wrong Thing.

Okay, so why is all this prefacing a post under the emacs tag? And didn't we start out talking about blogging? These points are connected -- I use emacs frequently. It is a key part of my daily workflow. Recently, I got out of using preconfigured emacs "distributions" like Spacemacs or Doom Emacs in favor of a roll-your-own sort of setup, and I found the process quite inviting. I currently maintain a literate configuration for my own Sakura Emacs. A goal I have had on my list for... hell, a few years now... has been to configure my emacs workspace in such a way that it integrates the various contexts I work in. Whether it be academic writing, research, programming, blogging, or journaling, my Holy Grail is an emacs configuration that Does All The Things, and does them in a way that is easy to maintain and easy to use.

So that's a tall order - or so I've always felt. But as I said, lately I've been poking around in the tools emacs offers. A few developments have begun to stick, after giving them a try, and I think I'm zeroing in on a few key tools that will make my life a lot easier.
