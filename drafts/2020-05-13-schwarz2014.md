In her (2014) article #How weak and how definite are Weak Definites?#, Florian Schwarz examines the case of so-called 'weak definite' arguments of VPs, as in expressions like 'read the newspaper'. The object of the verb is a definite noun phrase, but notably it does not pick out a contextually maximal or specific referent. Rather than analyzing such cases in terms of covariation in the denotation of the object noun phrase, Schwarz lets definites be definites and proposes that weak definite readings arise when such expressions serve as
objects to verb phrases denoting event kinds.

#Note:# Schwarz's proposal directly builds on the proposal of [[#dayal2011][Dayal (2011)]].
