In their (2011) article #Cross-linguistic representations of numerals and number marking#, Alan Bale, Michael Gagnon, and Hrayr Khanjian defend the idea that all modifiers, including numeral modifiers, are best understood as restrictors of NP and VP denotations. They narrowly concentrate on numeral modification, arguing that the evidence for a non-restrictive analysis is actually consistent with the empirical facts of the restrictive analysis. Their proposal accounts for the different crosslinguistic distribuitions of numerals and plural nouns by appealing to two different classes of restrictive modification, Subsective and Intersective Modification.
