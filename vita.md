## skills

### Typesetting in LaTeX & BibTeX

I have experience with ExPeX, pst-jTree, qTree, and many other packages

### Front-end web development

I have used HTML and CSS for years, but I have recently been working with Javascript (mostly ES6 using Node). I've been dabbling a little in Typescript as well. I'm fond of Vue.js and Vuex, and I have tooled around with various other frameworks.

### Python

I am learning Python as a side project, mostly playing around with the language for various modeling projects.

### Emacs Lisp

I have picked up a good amount of Lisp from configuring my Emacs environment.

## miscellanea

I am a native speaker of English, but I got my start in linguistics through a love for learning languages. I have varying levels of competence with a decent spread of languages, including Eastern Armenian, German, Russian, Arabic, French, and Hungarian. I know a smattering of Kotiria (East Tukanoan) from my work with the language.
