The core of the Simulacra engine is a state-based game loop, itself an extension of the `EventDispatch` class provided by the TCOD library. To get started, we want to define a base `State` class, from which we will extend all of the game&rsquo;s relevant states.

```python
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import Generic, TypeVar, TYPE_CHECKING

import tcod.event

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    import tcod.console as Console


T = TypeVar("T")


class State(Generic[T], tcod.event.EventDispatch[T]):

    def loop(self: State[T]) -> Optional[T]:
        while True:
            pass

    def ev_keydown(self: State[T], event: tcod.event.KeyDown) -> Optional[T]:
        pass
```

Let&rsquo;s unpack what&rsquo;s happening here. I&rsquo;ll assume little to no familiarity with using type hinting in Python, just for the sake of completeness. First we import the `annotations` feature from Python&rsquo;s `__future__` module. This feature was introduced in [PEP 563](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0563/) to permit forward reference to type annotations (e.g. if I want to annotate a variable `some_variable: MyType` before `MyType` is actually defined, which is often the case).

Once we have the annotations feature, we&rsquo;ll also want to import a number of type aliases from the `typing` module. I&rsquo;ll discuss each of these as we run into it in the code, with the exception of the final one: `typing.TYPE_CHECKING`. This handy constant is assumed to be `True` by 3rd party type checkers, but `False` at runtime; the practical effect is that we can import our local modules for typing purposes without running into annoying circular dependency errors at runtime.

Alright, so let&rsquo;s get to the heart of things.

```python
T = TypeVar("T")


class State(Generic[T], tcod.event.EventDispatch[T]):
    # ...
```

Our base `State` class inherits from the `Generic` base class and the `EventDispatch` class from the TCOD library&rsquo;s `event` module. We specified a type variable `T`, which allows us to abstract away from the specific type we expect the `State` object to deal with. One way to think of this is that we are specifying a &rsquo;domain&rsquo; that the `State` object will be responsible for, and we can leverage this type variable to specify operations that work with data in this domain. This will make more sense in a moment when we define the concrete class that will replace the type variable in the actual implementation.

The `tcod.event.EventDispatch` class is a basic&#x2026; er, event dispatcher. Specifically, it pays attention to various of its own methods (the ones defined with the prefix `ev_`) and handles the dispatching of input events to these methods. Our `State` object, in effect, is built on top of a very useful set of input event handlers that we can begin to work into the foundation of the game&rsquo;s I/O. With that in mind, we can go ahead and modify the `State.loop()` method we defined in the abstract above.

```python
    def loop(self: State[T]) -> Optional[T]:
        while True:
            for event in tcod.event.wait():
                # ...
```

Note firstly the annotation we&rsquo;ve given for the return type of the loop. The type `Optional[T]` means that sometimes we&rsquo;ll get a return type of `None`, but other times we&rsquo;ll get whatever the type `T` is from the domain our `State` is responsible for. The `tcod.event.wait()` method will sit around twiddling its thumbs until input events start pouring in, at which point it will return an iterator containing all pending events. The details of this aren&rsquo;t too important right now; the thing we&rsquo;ll want to use for our purposes is the `event` variable that ranges over the elements of this returned iterator. We want to toss each `event` to the dispatcher, and what we&rsquo;ll get back is either `None` or some valid value that we can proceed with.

We want to leverage this behavior to handle what happens in each case. If we return `None`, we want this to break our loop. This is possible because `None` is falsy, and therefore allows us to break our `while` loop. If we return anything else, we want to treat that as a valid return from our event dispatch and do some more work with it. Above our `State` class, let&rsquo;s add a new class that will extend the built-in `Exception` class:

```python
class StateBreak(Exception):
    """Breaks out of the active State.loop and forces it to return None."""
```

We can throw this into our loop as a `try ... except` statement to neatly handle our two possibilities.

```python
                try:
                    value = self.dispatch(event)
                except StateBreak:
                    return None
```

All that&rsquo;s left now is to handle what happens if `value` is not `None`, and so, `if value is not None:`

```python
    def loop(self: State[T]) -> Optional[T]:
        while True:
            for event in tcod.event.wait():
                try:
                    value = self.dispatch(event)
                except StateBreak:
                    return None
                if value is not None:
                    return value
```

We&rsquo;ll return `value`. But what exactly is `value`? It can be anything we want, really - but the easiest thing to make it is something that we can use to link our keyboard events to functions that will in turn send out things of type `T`. By itself, this isn&rsquo;t going to do a whole lot, of course. We can go ahead and provide an implementation for the `EventDispatch` class&rsquo;s `ev_keydown` method, which will allow us to subscribe to any incoming key press events.

```python
    def ev_keydown(self: State[T], event: tcod.event.KeyDown) -> Optional[T]:
        pass
```

Let&rsquo;s get used to thinking about these in terms of their types. The method `State.ev_keydown()` is looking to take in some event of type `tcod.event.KeyDown` and will return either `None`, breaking our state loop, or `T`.

Now, there are a ton of ways this could be implemented, but the way that I think is most flexible is to use a version of the Command pattern (on which read this wonderful section of [Game Programing Patterns](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/command.html)). In this implementation, we&rsquo;re going to create a tight linkage between the names of the methods and the symbols that get called when we perform certain commands, effectively allowing us to modify our command structure by (1) adding a new entry to the list of possible commands, and (2) creating a new command method. Here&rsquo;s an abstract of what I mean. First, add `Callable` and `Dict` to our import from `typing`:

```python
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import Callable, Dict, Generic, TypeVar, TYPE_CHECKING
```

And this is how the structure of `State` will end up looking:

```python
class State(Generic[T], tcod.event.EventDispatch[T]):

    COMMANDS: Dict[int, str] = {
        tcod.event.K_RETURN: "confirm",
        tcod.event.K_ESCAPE: "escape",
    }

    # ...

    def ev_keydown(self: State[T], event: tcod.event.KeyDown) -> Optional[T]:
        func: Callable[[], Optional[T]]
        if event.sym in self.COMMANDS:
            func = getattr(self, f"cmd_{self.COMMAND[event.sym]}")
            return func()
        return None

    def cmd_confirm(self: State[T]) -> Optional[T]:
        pass

    def cmd_escape(self: State[T]) -> Optional[T]:
        pass
```

Alright, so some explanation is in order. Inside of our `State` object, we&rsquo;re defining a dictionary that maps the `int` type keycodes to strings. These strings are the names of specific commands: notice that for `tcod.event.K_RETURN: "confirm"` we have a corresponding method `State.cmd_confirm(...)` which returns `None` or `T`. The way we handle this mapping in terms of the actual event dispatcher is to read the `sym` attribute of the `tcod.event.KeyDown` event, which is the integer keycode. For example, if I press `Enter` on my keyboard, `tcod.event.KeyDown.sym` will be `13`. We&rsquo;ve defined a variable `func` that is of type `Callable[[], Optional[T]]`, which is to say a function that takes in no arguments and returns something of type `Optional[T]`.

When the dispatcher returns `13` for `event.sym`, we plug that into the f-string that is fed into `getattr`, ultimately assigned to `func`. What we get back is a Python symbol `State.cmd_` + whatever `13` maps to in our dictionary, in this case `confirm`. The end result is that we&rsquo;ve generated a symbol `State.cmd_confirm`. We then return a call of that function: `return func()`, or `return State.cmd_confirm()`.

We can then put concrete statements into the implementation of this method, which is especially useful since we&rsquo;ll be overriding this method classes that inherit from `State`. And with that, we have the core of our event-based state engine.
