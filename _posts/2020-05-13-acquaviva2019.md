In his chapter 'Categorization as Noun Construction: Gender, Number, and Entity Types' in the (2019) book "Gender and Noun Classification", Paolo Acquaviva suggests that nouns, built incrementally from sub-lexical syntactic atoms, denote neither objects nor kinds. Instead, he suggests they serve as names of entity types, which in turn restrict the kind- or object-level denotation of the DP they embed under.
