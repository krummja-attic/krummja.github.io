In her (2011) article *Hindi Pseudo-Incorporation*, Veneeta Dayal claims that Hindi is a pseudo-incorporating language, wherein there is no requirement that the incorporated nominal form a surface constituent with the verb. She argues that Hindi shows the semantic characteristics of incorporation. She notably breaks from previous assumptions by taking such incorporated nouns as being specified for number, rather than number-neutral. Incorporated nominals, so specified, act as predicate modifiers, and any cumulative interpretation of the nominal reference is taken to be the result of aspectual characteristics of the
entire event description.
