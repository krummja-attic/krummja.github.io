### [p. 1] Main Claims
#### Three families of nominal licensing theories
1) Dependencies between nominals and functional atoms are responsible for Case and Licensing.
2) Sufficient locality to other nominals assigns Case; Licensing is distributed to other parts of the grammar.
3) Sufficient locality to other nominals assigns Case; Case is sufficient but not necessary to License nominals.
#### Licensing with Case
Nominals in Kikuyu may be licensed through sufficient locality with other nominals.
