In their (2010) article #The semantics and pragmatics of plurals#, Donka Farkas
and Henriette de Swart advance the claim that in language which show a binary
morphological opposition in singular nad plural number, the morphologically
unmarked singular is semantically unmarked, and the morphologically marked
plural is semantically marked; in this regard, they argue that their proposal
respects Horn's (2011) Division of Pragmatic Labor.

In their proposal, plural forms are polysemous between Exclusive and Inclusive
Senses. Plural forms are permitted only in case sum values are pragmatically
licensed as being among intended referents. Accounting for the two senses of
plurality, they appeal to an independently motivated pragmatic principle, the
Strongest Meaning Hypothesis.
