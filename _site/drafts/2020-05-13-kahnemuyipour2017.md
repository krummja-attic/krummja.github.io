This article continues their previous (2011) account on Armenian 2P. As before, I think that the facts can be better explained as an epiphenomenon: the auxiliary is actually in T, and it distributes as a phonological enclitic attaching to whichever element has greatest prosodic prominence. In non-focus structures, since the vP is the domain of sentential stress, it ends up as 2P in that domain. In focus structures, it is 2P following the focused element, since the focus prosody overrides the sentential stress prosody.
