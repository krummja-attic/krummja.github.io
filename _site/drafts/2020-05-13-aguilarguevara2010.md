In their (2010) article #Weak definites and reference to kinds#, Ana
Aguilar-Guevara and Joost Zwarts discuss weak definites, such as the definite object in expressions like "John is reading the newspaper". They argue that such expressions do not presuppose uniquely identifiable entities, but instead denote kinds, just like definite generics. Composition with object-level predicates is made possible through a lexical rule which lifts the object-level predicate to a kind-level relation.
