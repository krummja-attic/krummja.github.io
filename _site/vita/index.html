<p>I have used HTML and CSS for years, but I have recently been working with Javascript (mostly ES6 using Node). I’ve been dabbling a little in Typescript as well. I’m fond of Vue.js and Vuex, and I have tooled around with various other frameworks.</p>

<h3 id="emacs-lisp">Emacs Lisp</h3>

<p>I have picked up a good amount of Lisp from configuring my Emacs environment.</p>

<h2 id="miscellanea">miscellanea</h2>

<p>I am a native speaker of English, but I got my start in linguistics through a love for learning languages. I have varying levels of competence with a decent spread of languages, including Eastern Armenian, German, Russian, Arabic, French, and Hungarian. I know a smattering of Kotiria (East Tukanoan) from my work with the language.</p>
