In this post, I want to zoom in a little bit on the technicalia of paragraph construction. The goal of this week's discussion is to begin to work out a framework that we can use to make specific decisions about the way we organize our paragraphs. Let's start out from a very broad level, divorced from the specifics of writing for linguistics. We'll focus on the basics of paragraph construction, and how it relates to the effective presentation of the content of our writing.

## The Uneven U

One of my favorite writing books, Eric Hayot's *The Elements of Academic Style*, introduces a very useful tool for organizing paragraphs in academic writing.[^1] This tool, the **Uneven U**, is a system for assigning the internal structure of a paragraph to a specific function related to the central evidence the piece of writing aims to present. Let's look at an example before diving into definitions. The following is from a monograph written by Luis LÃ³pez, dealing with a certain type of noun phrase interpretation.[^2]

If I asked you to examine this excerpt and arrange the sentences in terms of how related they are to the example in (3), how might you go about doing so?

Well, patently the sentence just before the data point, which explicitly calls our attention to it (i.e. "[...] in the Spanish sentence (3), the presence of [...]"). This sentence is just about as close to the data as we can get without directly embedding it in a sentence.

What about the sentence just before it? The connecting phrase *For instance* indicates that the sentence before it must have been broader, such that it required a narrowing of focus down to a particular example.

Here is a neat trick: let's see what happens if we take out sentence [2] and the example in (3):

> Linguists working in the tradition of differential object marking (DOM) (see Bossong 1985; Aissen 2003) have connected a piece of morphology with a specific interpretation.
> Other linguists---in particular, Diesing (1992)---have linked specificity with scrambling. [...]

Ah! If we collapse the "dip" into the specific evidence, notice that we appear to have a single continuous idea. So this structure of starting broad, descending to the level of specific data, and then broading our focus back out can serve as a general schema for paragraph construction.

The numbers along the y-axis are the "levels" assigned to each sentence based on proximity to the data. Hayot provides the following general descriptions for these levels:

5. abstract, general; oriented toward a solution or a conclusion
4. less general; oriented toward a problem; pulls ideas together
3. conceptual summary; draws together two or more pieces of evidence, or introduces a broad example
2. description; plain or interpretive summary; establishing shot
1. concrete; evidentiary; raw, unmediated data or information

But this by itself seems not to be *terribly* insightful; after all, it's easier to rank the sentences of a paragraph when there are only a few, and they make a clear division of function. When we make our paragraphs slightly more complex, we have a bit more room to maneuver. And this is where a more robust typology can be useful. Let's look at another example, this time dealing with material more familiar to us.

Starting from sentence [1], this appears to be a pretty broad statement, dealing with theoretical concepts like comparison of two languages in terms of phrase structure---perhaps **Level 4**. Sentence [2] gets a little more specific, telling us that we're dealing with the structure of noun phrases, in particular---more like **Level 3**. It draws our attention to a problem or topic we're going to provide concrete evidence for. 

Sentences [3-5] bring us directly down to the level of the data presented in (1) and (2). Together they describe the data in clear terms, pointing out which facts of comparison the reader should be paying attention to---accordingly, **Level 1**. On the other side of the data set, sentence [6] broadens back out to a level closer to sentence [2], and goes a little farther still. It makes a strong assertion about what the data signify; it provides an *analysis* of the data that [3-5] merely *surveyed*. Sentences [7-9] continue this outward trend, further analyzing the data and providing generalizations over the data---**Level 4**.

Finally, sentence [10] draws together the all of the preceding into formal terms that generalize over both languages, i.e. by providing two phrase structure rules, we're now talking in terms of a formalism that *abstracts* away from the specifics of the individual languages---**Level 5**. If we wanted to descrbe the overall structure of this paragraph, it would proceed roughly **4 > 3 > 1 > 4 > 5**. Thus, we've implemented an "Uneven U" structure. 

Before closing out this post, let's also do what we did with the first excerpt and cut out all the material except for the first and last sentences, just for kicks:

> Indonesian phrase structure has many commonalities with the phrase structure of English.
> These facts are summarized and contrasted with English in (3).

Hmm... this could be better! Notice that the beginning of the last sentence uses a deictic, "these" facts, requiring the reader to look back at the previous sentence. In the next post, we'll revisit this issue and figure out some ways we can make our sentences more concrete and tightened up with the rest of the paragraph.
