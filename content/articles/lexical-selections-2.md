Hello again, and welcome to the second post in the *Lexical Selections* series. Today we will delve into some practical matters concerning the basics of the presentational style used in the linguistic sciences. The goal here is to help you start putting together a palette of fundamentals that, when applied to specific situations in presenting your discussion, will provide important texture to your argument. For now, we'll start with some of the more rote guidelines for linguistics writing, but in future posts we can start to get into some of the more interesting issues like the distinction between merely describing and providing satisfactory explanation. But those are issues that ultimately tie into methodological and theoretical concerns we have yet to appreciate fully, so let's not jump the gun and get into the more basic - but no less important - aspects of style.

To begin, let's understand our [*writing situation*](https://wac.colostate.edu/resources/writing/guides/writing-situations/). Linguistics is properly understood to be a constellation of related sciences, each aimed at understanding some part of the uniquely human faculty for language. Different disciplines (e.g. syntax, phonology, semantics) have some differences in how they present themselves in writing, but there are certain universals that apply no matter the area of linguistics you're in. As a starting point, let's consider a paragraph that models what you might expect to say in some of the later essays for this course:

<p style="padding: 0 8%; margin: 40px 0;">
    German speakers typically do not use the past tense. Instead, they use the verbs sein, to be and haben, to have. In English, this would be like using the perfect, which is different from tense. For example, ich habe den Film gesehen can be translated as I have seen the movie or I saw the movie. Some other examples might be Sie sind gelaufen for they have run or they ran, and du hast Blumen gepflückt for you have picked flowers or you picked flowers.
</p>

Alright, so that was a bit rough. If you had little or no context for what the paragraph was dealing with, I'm sure you will leave feeling a bit confused. There are some ways we can improve the basic presentational characteristics of this paragraph, and they're fairly straightforward. Let's start by taking tally of the things that we might want to adjust in the paragraph above.

1. What specifically do we mean by 'the past tense' and how does it relate to concepts we understand in English?
2. Do the verbs *sein* and *haben* fall into any useful subcategories that we might want to consider for generalizing over them (i.e. separating them from regular content verbs)?
3. Can we make a clearer distinction between the text of the prose, the German examples, and the English translations of those examples?
4. What is meant by 'the perfect' here? How does it more precisely relate to tense, as suggested?
5. Can we make the longer examples in the later part of the paragraph more readable?

Thankfully, each of these has a fairly straightforward answer. Issues (1) and (4) are just definitional, and can benefit from small adjustments to how they are brought up in the prose. Issue (2) is similar in that it is just a definitional issue; we can clarify by using some more precise terminology. Finally, issues (3) and (5) benefit from being subject to some very standard stylistic guidelines for the presentation of linguistic data. Let's clean up the paragraph, and then we can turn to discussing what specific changes we made.

<p style="padding: 0 8%; margin: 40px 0;">
<span style="color: red;">In everyday speech,</span> German speakers typically do not use the <span style="color: red;">simple</span> past tense <span style="color: red;">(like English <i>sat</i>, <i>played</i>, or <i>sang</i>)</span>. Instead, they use the <span style="color: red;">auxiliary</span> verbs <span style="color: red;"><i>sein</i> 'to be'</span> and <span style="color: red;"><i>haben</i> 'to have'</span>. In English, this would be like using the perfect <span style="color: red;">aspect</span>, which is different from tense. <span style="color: red;">If a speaker were to say "ich habe den Film gesehen",</span> this can be translated as <span style="color: red;">'I have seen the movie'</span> or <span style="color: red;">'I saw the movie'</span>. <span style="color: red;">Note the following additional examples:</span><br/><br/>

<div style="color: red; padding: 0 8%; margin: -40px 40px 40px 0;">
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td style="padding-right: 8px;">(1)</td>
            <td style="padding-right: 8px;">Sie</td>
            <td style="padding-right: 8px;">sind</td>
            <td style="padding-right: 8px;">gelaufen</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td style="padding-right: 8px;">they</td>
            <td style="padding-right: 8px;">have</td>
            <td style="padding-right: 8px;">run</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <span style="padding-left: 32px;">'They have run./They ran.'</span>
</div>


<div style="color: red; padding: 0 8%; margin: -10px 40px 40px 0;">
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td style="padding-right: 8px;">(2)</td>
            <td style="padding-right: 8px;">Du</td>
            <td style="padding-right: 8px;">hast</td>
            <td style="padding-right: 8px;">Blumen</td>
            <td style="padding-right: 8px;">gepflückt</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td style="padding-right: 8px;">you</td>
            <td style="padding-right: 8px;">have</td>
            <td style="padding-right: 8px;">flowers</td>
            <td style="padding-right: 8px;">picked</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <span style="padding-left: 32px;">'You have picked flowers./You picked flowers.'</span>
</div>

</p>

Let's run down the list here.

Firstly, we clarified that the data we're concerned with are specific to everyday speech - that is, in writing this may not be (and in fact often is not) true. Next, we added some modifiers to theoretically laden words. For example, *simple past tense* replaces *past tense* to clarify that we are talking about the non-analytical form of the verb - the one that doesn't rely on verbal auxiliaries. We further clarify by providing English data to exemplify what this would look like in terms familiar to the reader. In a similar vein, we amended *perfect* with *aspect* to specify that we're talking about a specific part of the grammar.

Next, we specified the type of verb relevant to the discussion by picking out *auxiliary verbs*, which behave differently from lexical verbs (things like *laufen* 'to run' or the non-auxiliary verb *haben* 'to have').

Most importantly, we've enormously improved the paragraph's readability by simply applying some basic punctuation used to set off the data from the target language (expressions of German) from their equivalents in English. Specifically:

- When referring to an expression in the target language in the body of a paragraph, use *italics*.
- When referring to the meaning of an expression - more formally, its **gloss** - use 'single' quotation marks.
- When quoting someone or providing a colloquial translation or paragraph, use "double" quotation marks.
- Always translate non-English words.
- If using a non-Latin script, transliterate! Feel free to ask for resources on this if you are unsure how to do this appropriately for specific languages.
- Number longer/more substantive examples and set them apart from the prose.

Regarding the last point in (6), be sure to take a look at the [Leipzig glossing rules](https://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/pdf/Glossing-Rules.pdf) which are the standard for linguistic publications.

And that's about it for the basics for now. I know this might seem like a lot, but the conventions are really pretty straightforward. With a bit of practice, it becomes second nature to present linguistic discussions this way. And remember, if at any point you would like to discuss an issue in your writing or get general tips on how your writing can be improved, you are always free to contact me to set up a meeting or to come by office hours!

That's it for now; see you again next week where we'll turn to some of the aforementioned more interesting aspects of writing for linguistics.
