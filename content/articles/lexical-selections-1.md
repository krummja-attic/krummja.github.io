Hello there, and welcome! This is the first post in a series of blog posts aimed at exploring writing-related topics for UGA's LING3150W. Normally, I would be supporting the course face-to-face, but given the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, I wanted to find a way of reliably delivering writing-related content to students of the courses I support without a physical presence on campus.

So, from here through the remainder of the semester, I will be composing weekly blog posts under the series title *Lexical Selections*. The central focus of this series is to address issues in such areas as writing for the sciences, interdisciplinary writing, and writing for linguistics. As much as I am in my current field because I love the research and scholarship associated with it, I have come to enjoy the process of planning, composing, and sharing the results of my work. I won't delve too much into my philosophy on writing right now, but rest assured that we will get to some of the interesting kernels of what motivates us to write, how we write, and who we write for in the coming weeks - mark my words!

With all that out of the way, let me start with necessary introductions.

My name is Jonathan, and I am a PhD student with UGA's Department of Linguistics. I will be supporting LING3150W as the course's writing intensive teaching assistant (although you might like to think of me as a writing coach or tutor).  As a linguist, my research mostly deals with the way syntactic structure determines what expressions mean - that is, the *semantics* of those expressions.

By way of example, consider the following data.

    (1) a. Mary has a dog
        b. Mary has dogs

What the expression in (1a) asserts is that Mary has exactly *one dog*; the expression in (1b), on the other hand, asserts that Mary has *more than one dog*. That is, if I say (1b) and you go over to Mary's house all excited to hang out with a panoply of puppies, you're likely to be pretty disappointed to find that Mary actually only has *one* dog. In fact, you might even say that I've *lied*.

Okay, so what? Any native speaker of English, if asked to explain what a "singular" noun means in contrast to a "plural" noun, might characterize the difference along the following lines: the singular is used to refer to *one* of a thing, while the plural is used to refer to *more than one* of a thing. Let's formalize this as a working hypothesis:

> Noun phrases of English that are morphologically singular (e.g. *a dog*) mean "one of" whatever the noun is referring to.
> Noun phrases of English that are morphologically plural (e.g. *dogs*) mean "more than one" of whatever the noun is referring to.

With a hypothesis in hand, we can test each premise. A common experimental condition is to see if that intuition - the alignment of *singular : one :: plural : more than one* - holds up in different types of sentences. Accordingly, consider:

    (2) Does Mary have a dog?

If Mary in fact has one dog, then you can safely answer (2) positively - yes, she has *a dog*. Interestingly, you can probably answer positively in the case that she has more than one dog, although you might clarify - yes, she does... actually she has *two* dogs. What this means is that the apparently singular noun phrase *a dog* actually does allow us to refer to more than one of something, in the right contexts.

We can take this farther, however. Consider the question parallel to (1b).

	(3) Does Mary have dogs?

Regardless of whether Mary has one dog or more than one dog, you are likely to answer (3) positively. Just as with (2), which shows that in the right contexts a noun phrase in the singular can refer to more than one of something, (3) shows us that a noun phrase in the plural can refer to one of something just fine.

So what gives?

Well, this is the heart of the issue - what exactly *does* give? We observed what seemed like a pretty solid characterization of (1) actually fails to hold up to scrutiny. That is, we developed a basic hypothesis, and with the addition of more complex data in (2) and (3), disconfirmed our working hypothesis - at least for English. We can adjust our hypothesis to something like the following:

> Noun phrases of English that are morphologically singular (e.g. *a dog*) mean "one of" whatever the noun is referring to **in positive assertions**.
> Noun phrases of English that are morphologically plural (e.g. *dogs*) mean "more than one" of whatever the noun is referring to **in positive assertions**.

We then might add:

> Noun phrases of English that are morphologically singular or plural mean "one or more of" whatever the noun is referring to **in polar (yes/no) questions**.

To sum up: with a basic generalization from one point of data, we were able to (a) develop a working hypothesis, (b) develop additional supporting data to compare against, (c) run a simple experiment to test that hypothesis, and (d) come out the other side with some preliminary conclusions about the data.

You might have noticed that what started with a brief discussion about my interests developed into a short-ish essay about a specific linguistic phenomenon - well, this is the essence of this course! I like to quip at this point that *writing intensive* doesn't have to mean *intensive writing*. On the contrary, writing can be a fun process that in its own right helps us to shape and develop our thinking. What's nice about this is that when it comes to writing up the results of your thinking, you've already done most of the work. All that's left is to edit and send it off for review.

Okay, so that's the sort of stuff I like to work on, and writing about it is one of the ways I like to approach understanding it. There's a lot more to cover, of course, but that's a topic for another post.

I think that's about enough for an introduction. In the coming weeks, I look forward to getting to know all of you, and I hope that you will similarly look forward to improving at writing as we work towards developing a basic theory of human language!
