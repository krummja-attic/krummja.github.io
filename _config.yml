biography: "My name is Jonathan Crum, and I am a PhD student at the University of Georgia working in the area of theoretical linguistics.

My current research interests have led me to the study of incorporation phenomena; this project is part of a larger set of projects that aim to investigate the relationship between syntax and semantics, particularly as applied to the interpretation of predicates."
